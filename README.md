# election-analysis overview
Using Python 3.7.6 and VS Code a CSV containing the votes for a political office in three counties were analysed to determine the total number of votes, the discrete candidates, the amount of votes received by each candidate, and therefore the candidates percent of total votes and the overall winner of the election.  The results were written to the file election_analysis.txt.  

#PyPoll_Challenge was then created using the same material that also added an analysis of the county votes to determine the percentages of total votes cast in the three counties and the county in which the most votes were cast.
